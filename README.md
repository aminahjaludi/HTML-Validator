# HTML Validator

## Overview

This C++ project provides a tool for validating HTML files. Given an html file, the program checks that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag, except for self-closing tags. This ensures that the HTML structure is properly balanced.

<br>

## Features

- **Tag Matching**: Verifies that each opening tag has a corresponding closing tag.
- **Self-Closing Tags**: Recognizes and correctly processes self-closing tags (e.g., `<img>`, `<br>`, `<input>`).
